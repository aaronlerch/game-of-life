# Game of Life

I had a few minutes on an airplane and decided to have some fun with [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

There's no emphasis on any sort of quality here. :)

# Modes

## Console

The console view is the default and uses `Curses` to render a text-based view in the terminal.

## Window

The window view selected using the `window` parameter (e.g. `./life window`) and uses Gosu to render the game board using 2D graphics.
